# Word Count Application

This Python application counts the occurrences of each word in a text file and prints the counts in descending order of frequency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- No external libraries are required beyond the Python Standard Library.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-counter-python.git
```

cd word-counter-python
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command in the project directory:

```bash  
python3 word_count.py <path_to_your_text_file>
```

Replace `<path_to_your_text_file>` with the path to the text file you want to analyze.

### Running the Tests
